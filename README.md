# UCI GeoGuesser

Utilizing the Crow library in C++ and the React framework, we will create a website for our game. The game will consist of pictures where you must guess the location. All locations are at the University of California, Irvine. Additionally, we will implement a bot mode. We will train the model with images from UCI so the bot can gather data on signs and the environment to produce an accurate result.
