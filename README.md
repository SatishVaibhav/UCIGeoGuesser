# UCI GeoGuesser

Utilizing QT library in C++, we will create a GUI for our game. The game will consist of pictures where you must guess the location. All locations are at the University of California, Irvine. Additionally, we will implement a bot mode. We will train the model with images from UCI so the bot can gather data on signs and the environment to produce an accurate result.
